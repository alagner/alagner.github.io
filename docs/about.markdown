Engineer and retrogamer.

Profesionally I use mostly modern C++; I also have some experience in several other technologies.
Therefore, please expect mostly C++-related topics. Other tech-related topics, like electronics, automation etc. 
are also likely to appear.

Hopefully you'll find the articles useful.
